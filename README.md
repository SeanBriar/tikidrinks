Approach Taken: A MEAN stack, full CRUD app. As a group we collectively created a Trello board where we could easily manage and assign tasks. Back-end and Front-end functionality were created simultaneously with communication between members via Slack and Zoom.


User Stories: As a user, I can browse my favorite tropical beverages in a directory that I have created. I am able to log-in with a unique username and password. Once logged in, I am able to edit and delete drinks, submit comments, and like drinks.

Unsolved Problems:

Notes: In the future, we would like to incorporate a yelp API so users can search for high rated tropical inspired drinks in their area.
