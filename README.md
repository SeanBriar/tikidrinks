Approach Taken: A MEAN stack, full CRUD app. As a group we collectively created a Trello board where we could easily manage and assign tasks. Back-end and Front-end functionality were created simultaneously with communication between members via Slack and Zoom. 

Unsolved Problems:

User Stories: As a user, I can browse my favorite tropical beverages in a directory that I have created by adding, editing, and deleting drinks. I am also able to log-in with a unique username and password.
